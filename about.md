I'm a software engineer at LogMeIn and sometimes I teach at Training360.

When I'm not working, I'm researching the patterns and algorithms connecting basketball, trail running, and drums. My devotion for impeccable user interfaces is rivaled only by my constant search for the perfect brew of Chinese green tea.
